# 🌟 Github Starred List

A low-effort attempt to automate categorizing starred repositories on GitHub because the REST API isn't going to do that anytime soon.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/haile01/github-starred-list/
```

## 📖 Usage

Initialize with your GitHub username and the cookie header grabbed from `https://github.com/<username>?tab=stars`.

*Note: The cookie will only last for 2 weeks.*

```python
gh-list create --user "gh_username" --cookie "cookie_str" --list "listname" --desc "sample"

gh-list add --user "gh_username" --cookie "cookie_str" --list "listname" --repo "repo_url" 

gh-list remove --user "gh_username" --cookie "cookie_str --list "listname" --repo "repo_url"

gh-list delete --user "gh_username" --cookie "cookie_str" --list "listname"
```

For more information, run `gh-list --help`.

## Built With `gh-list`

- [StarListify](https://github.com/nhtlongcs/StarListify) StarListify is a Python package that transforms your GitHub stars into an organized, categorized resource, making it easy to browse and access your starred repositories. By fetching starred repositories and extracting key information—like the README content—it sorts them into lists based on custom user preferences or README-inferred topics.

## ❓ FAQ

### How to get the cookie string?

### I pasted the cookie string but it's not working?


- The cookie string is only valid for 2 weeks. If you encounter this issue, you need to grab a new cookie string. 
- Make sure the cookie string is enclosed in double quotes.
- Make sure the cookie string is copied correctly. The cookie string format should be `key=value; key=value; ...`. The expected cookie string format is shown below:
```cookies
_octo=<value>; 
preferred_color_mode=<value>; 
_device_id=<value>; 
user_session=<value>; 
__Host-user_session_same_site=<value>; 
tz=<value>; 
color_mode=<value>; 
logged_in=<value>; 
dotcom_user=<value>; 
GHCC=<value>; 
tz=<value>; 
_gh_sess=<value>;
```
